# Privileged Intents

Zeppelin requires [Privileged Intents](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6207308062871-What-are-Privileged-Intents) for some of its features.
If your instance of the bot can see more than 10,000 members, you might need to complete Discord's [Privileged Intent Review](https://docs.discord.com/developers/gateway/getting-started-with-privileged-intent-review).
Below are some guidelines for answering the questions in the review. Note that these are just a starting point -- you must adjust the answers to match your own setup where appropriate.
